RAPIDKRILL is a Python application for processing echosounder data to
derive krill distribution and biomass estimates in near real-time. The
software is intended to operate onboard ships of opportunity
(e.g. fishing vessels) and relay metrics to land-based scientists.

RAPIDKRILL reads RAW files generated by a SIMRAD EK60 echosounder,
processes them and sends summary metrics back to scientists via
periodic emails. The software has primarily been designed to run on
small, cheap single-board computers such as the [Raspberry
Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
but can also run on desktop computers (We have tested with Linux and
OS X systems).
